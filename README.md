# PhotoTorrent
Zero Install, Peer-to-Peer, Lossless Photo Group Collaboration. 
This web app (React, NodeJS/Express) uses 
[WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) 
to share original photos between peers, 
using WebRTC and the NodeJS server that 
shares magnet links. 
The UI extracts and renders Exif and XMP metadata.

This is in an experimental stage.

# Install and Run

```
git clone ...
cd ...
npm run install-start
```

Add an index.js file inside `server/secret/` with account credentials 
to your Twilio account for their NAT traversal.
```exports.twilio = {
     accountSid: '',
     authToken: ''
   };
```

### parsetorrent
This app uses [parse-torrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/parse-torrent) 
but recompiled it to make it work with the create-react-app build using: 
`browserify -s parsetorrent -e ./ -o parsetorrent.js`
The recompiled version can be found in `ui/public/parsetorrent.js`
